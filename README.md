Hey there, I'm @MITCHELLKURTZMAN. I enjoy Blockchain, Finance, Business and Engineering.

Currently, I'm an engineer building Nuance.xyz on the Internet Computer blockchain. Here are some highlights of my projects and past achievements:

1. **Nuance.xyz**
   * Nuance is a blogging application, the application itself is a smart contract (no AWS or centralized party involved), the data, code and state are all stored on a blockchain, and served to the end user at web speed.

2. **Motoko Boot Camp (student)**
   * Early in 2023 I won first prize in Motoko Boot Camp for a censorship resistant, quadratic voting application. I essentially recreated a basic  concept of Dfinity's neuron voting system. Keep in mind, this was built hackathon style over the course of a few days and is not meant to be a full fledged app, just a proof of concept.

3. **Motoko Boot Camp (contributor)**
   * Seb, one of the founders of the boot camp had a vision/need for a code checking application and dashboard tool for the next boot camp. I shared this vision as I'd completed Harvard cs50x course a few years prior, and it had a fantastic code checking tool, a concept I wanted to bring to the Internet Computer Blockchain. As a result of the application hundreds of students were able to complete the course autonomously, freeing up instructors from grading projects 1 by 1 and allowing them to focus their energy where needed.

4. **AI on the IC**
   * I've taken a recent interest in bringing AI to the Internet Computer Blockchain, so far I've built a few applications that use the Open AI API, one of which is a flashcard generator, to which you choose a topic and it generates flashcards around the topic. This is a powerful design concept in my opinion, because the user experience can be supercharged, on top of the marketplace ability, security, transparency of a blockchain.

5. **Twitter/AI bot**
   * I've built a twitter bot that summarizes my research into tweets, this was fun to build but I've found the AI's voice is not very authentic to my style, so I've shut down the bot until I can train it to my liking.

6. **Modclub SNS launch**
   * Assisted in the testing, preperation, launch and operation of Modclub's SNS.
   * The swap transfered over 650k ICP ($2M+ USD) and there were 350 participants.
   * Great work to the Modclub team for building a cool product,  it was a pleasure to help get you guys across the line!

7. **Whats next?**
   * I'm building with mulitple teams on the [IC](https://internetcomputer.org/) to launch their [SNS DAOs](https://internetcomputer.org/sns) 
   * I want to learn rust, tensorflow.js and get an FAA drone operators licence.
   * I'm brainstorming useful B2B dapp ideas on the IC.
