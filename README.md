Hey there, I'm @MITCHELLKURTZMAN. I enjoy Blockchain, Finance, Business and Engineering.

I'm currently building Nuance.xyz on the Internet Computer blockchain:
* Nuance is a blogging application, the application itself is a smart contract (no AWS or centralized party involved), the data, code and state are all stored on a blockchain, and served to the end user at web speed.

* Early in 2023 I won first prize in Motoko Boot Camp for a censorship resistant, quadratic voting application. I essentially recreated a basic  concept of Dfinity's neuron voting system. Seb, one of the founders of the boot camp had a vision/need for a code checking application and dashboard tool for the next boot camp. I shared this vision as I'd completed Harvard cs50x course a few years prior, and it had a fantastic code checking tool, a concept I wanted to bring to the Internet Computer Blockchain. As a result of the application hundreds of students were able to complete the course autonomously, freeing up instructors from grading projects 1 by 1 and allowing them to focus their energy where needed.

* I've taken a recent interest in bringing AI to the Internet Computer Blockchain, so far I've built a few applications that use the Open AI API, one of which is a flashcard generator, to which you choose a topic and it generates flashcards around the topic. This is a powerful design concept in my opinion, because the user experience can be supercharged, on top of the marketplace ability, security, transparency of a blockchain.

* Currently I'm building a cross social poster for a grant, if you run a social media dapp on the IC please reach out and I will include your dapp in the beta. To be continued...
